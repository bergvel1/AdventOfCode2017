# Solutions for Advent of Code 2017

Here are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). All solutions are written in C, except for day 8, which is written in OCaml, and days 22, 24, and 25, which are written in Java. Although I have not included the code here, I should mention that my Java solutions make use of [@snarkbait's](https://github.com/snarkbait) utility classes for fetching puzzle inputs from the Advent of Code website. I found this code through the Advent of Code [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
